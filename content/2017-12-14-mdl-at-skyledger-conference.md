Since MDL Talent Hub is closely considering employing CXO technology and becoming a part of the Skyledger ecosystem,  we were kindly invited to present our project to Shanghai blockchain enthusiasts and investors. 

Skyledger is positioning itself as blockchain 3.0 and is strongly supported by business and IT communities. The technology is developed here in Shanghai by an international team and is aiming to overcome other DAO protocols. 

MDL happy to be so close to one of the most advanced tech movements in China and the World.
